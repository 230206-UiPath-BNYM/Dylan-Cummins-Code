Hello! I am Dylan Cummins and this is my repository! This is where I keep 
my demos for training. All demos are partitioned to folders pertaining to 
when they were discussed on a weeky basis. For example, week-1 folder 
would contain all the demos in week 1 of training.


If you have any questions about this repository feel free to reach out. Thank you

An interesting fact about Dylan is that he has torn his ACL and meniscus twice.
